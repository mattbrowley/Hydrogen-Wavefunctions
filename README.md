# Hydrogen-Wavefunctions
Just a Markdown (and LaTeX) file which gathers together all the hydrogenic wavefunctions you could ever want.

##Complete Wavefunctions

###Complex-Valued
$\Psi_{1,0,0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(\frac{Z}{a_0}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}e^{-\frac{r}{a_0}}$


###Real-Valued

###Angular Functions (Spherical Harmonics)

###Radial Functions (Associcated Laguerre Polynomials)
